# android_sdk_demo_app
Application demonstrating / testing the mobile SDK functions. 

This application is intended to give a baseline implementation for each of the individual functions that the [Payroc Mobile SDK](https://github.com/payroc/android_pos_sdk) offers. This is in an effort to offer a semi-integrated solution certified with TSYS or Vantiv respectively. 

## Dependencies
- Android Studio (target sdk 28, min 19)
- Kotliln
- DOKKA  ?? see if we can remove from public deps
- TBD

## Getting started
Once you have the repo cloned, then you should be able to run the app right out of the box! We utilize the strengths of Fragments in Android to cleanly organize each typical use case for the SDK. This should give you a solid feel for how this can be applied to your App, or in some cases, 
you should be able to copy fragments, and views to your app and be able to use them out of the box with little added effort. They are intentionally left "bland" to aid in ease-of-styling if you do decide to use our template.

## TBD
